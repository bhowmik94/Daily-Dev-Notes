# Daily-Dev-Notes
This is my personal space for keeping tabs on daily learning activities. This repo will act as a personalized diary for me to track whatever small albeit new things I learn everyday.

## 10/10/2025 
- Deployed NotePilot backend successfully at render. Added universal API access in mongoDB atlas.
- Added auto testing, branch protection, prettier and linting checks in NotePilot-UI frontend repository.
- Stricter push and merge check in NotePilot-UI now.
- Both frontend and backend are following basic CD rules (auto deployment while pushing to main branch).
